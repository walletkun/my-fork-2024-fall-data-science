### How to run / develop streamlit on your own machine
I would first just do `pip install streamlit`, however, you can also run the requirements. 

1. Install the requirements

   ```
   $ pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the app

   ```
   $ streamlit run streamlit_app.py
   ```
To run any streamlit app, you just type in `streamlit run <name_of_app_file.py>`. Above we are running the streamlit app that is coded in the `streamlit_app.py` file.  

### Editing your app
0. Open the `streamlit_app.py` file in your favorite IDE text editor.
0. Open the webpage of the [streamlit cheat sheet](https://cheat-sheet.streamlit.app/)
![alt text](image-2.png)
0. Streamlit markdown uses Github Flavored Markdown. Here is a [cheat sheet for github flavored markdown formatting](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
